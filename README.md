### Description

Toxetris is a version of the classical game, TETRIS. The difference is that, the pieces are sliding, not jumping to the next square. Also you can pull down faster. It is a one week project.

All the files are accesible. You can change them.

The sliding pieces bring some problems: Most of the time, I have to check more positions for a piece if it is an empty place or not. Anyway, here it is...

Pl

ease write in your comments if you check it.
 
### More Info
 
The speed of the game depends on your machines processor.

Just because I haven't got a good timer.

The mouse icon will be unvisible inside the form.
